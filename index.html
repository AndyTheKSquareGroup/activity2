                    <h2>About Kinchil</h2>
                    <p>Kinchil is located in the territory that was the jurisdiction of the Ah Canul before the
                        conquest
                        of Yucatán.
                    </p>
                    <p>No precise information is known about the founding of the town before the conquest of Yucatan
                        by
                        the Spaniards. It is known, however, that during the colony it was under the regime of the
                        encomiendas, among which we can mention Pedro Castellanos and Petrona Magaña Dorantes.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1825, after the independence of Yucatan, Kinchil was part of the Camino Real Bajo Party,
                        with
                        its capital in Hunucmá.
                        When the Organic Law of the Municipalities of the State of Yucatan came into effect in 1918,
                        Kinchil became the head of the free municipality of the same name.

                    <h3>Who was Felipa Poot?</h3>
                    <p>Felipa Poot, a Mayan leader, was gunned down by a gunman of the PNR senatorial candidate,
                        Gualberto Carrillo Puerto.</p>
                    <p>elipa Poot, despite her young age, had a distinguished career as a defender of the rights of
                        women and the Mayan people, and had organized a literacy program for adults working in the
                        fields of western Yucatán. She was also president of the "Rita Cetina" Feminist League, founded
                        by Elvia Carrillo Púerto, in her native Kinchil.</p>
                    <p>On January 4, 1936, Felipa Poot Tzuc's name became known in Yucatán when she traveled to the
                        state capital to demand that Governor Fernando López Cárdenas dismiss the mayor of Kinchil, Juan
                        de Mata Solís, who was linked to a group that had gained power after the large landowners were
                        displaced during the Revolution.</p>
                    <p>On the afternoon of March 28, 1936, Felipa confronted a man named Juan Méndez, a supporter of
                        Carrillo Puerto; in front of several people, the woman stripped him of a knife, causing his
                        public humiliation. Felipa, upon approaching the corner of 20th and 25th streets, was shot at.
                    </p>
                    <p>The figure of Felipa challenges the patriarchal order that not even the Revolution had managed to
                        overthrow.</p>

                    <h2>The food I love</h2>
                    <p>My favorite food isn't exclusive from Kinchil but from Yucatán, I love panuchos with roasted
                        chicken. Although I like me all panuchos made in Kinchil, I only love the panuchos made by Doña
                        Silvia.</p>

                    <h3>Only panuchos?</br>Tip.</h3>
                    <p>If by any chance you pass for Kinchi, you don´t hesitate to buy Doña Sivia´s panuchos. I'm
                        forgetting other delicious food, the sopes also made by Doña Silvia. I recommend those delicious
                        sopes.</p>
